<h3>Apache OJB</h3>

<p>
   ObJectRelationalBridge (OJB) is an Object/Relational mapping tool that allows transparent persistence for Java Objects against relational databases.
</p>

<p>
   An ORM tool is a natural match to Compass OSEM features. A simple Compass::Gps device that can index all the data that has both OSEM and ORM mapping definition can be easily developed, and if the ORM tool provides support for events, then mirroring can be supported as well.
</p>

<p>
   Note that most, if not all of the time, enabling full text search on the application domain model when using Ojb will not require any coding.
</p>

<p>
   The following are the features for the Compass::Gps OJB device:
   <ul>
      <li>Index Operation: For objects (classes) that has both ORM and OSEM definitions, the OjbGpsDevice can index all the relevant data.</li>
      <li>Mirror Operation: For objects (classes) that has both ORM and OSEM definitions, OjbGpsDevice based on the Ojb event mechanism for updated/created/deleted events can mirror any data changes made to using the ORM tool to the index (Compass::Gps calls it "Passive Mirror Device").</li>
   </ul>
</p>
