COMPASS UPGRADE DOCUMENTATION (Please see Compass JIRA for a complete change-log)
================================================================================

VERSION 1.2 GA ()
=================

1. Extending AbstractBasicConverter for custom converters should now override doFromString (and
   possibly doToString) instead of the previous fromString and toString. The converter code will
   remain the same.


VERSION 1.2 RC1 (September 4, 2007)
===================================

NONE


VERSION 1.2 M3 (August 3, 2007)
===============================

1. New HibernateGpsDevice with mcuh improved features. Hibernate3GpsDevice, Hibernate2GpsDevice, and
   SpringHibernate3GpsDevice refactored to a different package with "dep" at the end.

VERSION 1.2 M2 (June 25, 2007)
==============================

1. Lucene version upgraded to 2.2. Make sure to updated Lucene jars with the new versions.

VERSION 1.2 M1 (May 11, 2007)
=============================

1. Lucene version upgraded to 2.1 with Compass support for lockless commits. Make sure to update the Lucene jars
   with the new version. A full reindex of the data is required.
2. All references and settings for transaction commit locks have been removed thanks to lockless commits.
3. compass.transaction.lockDir removed and no longer used. The lock by default is now stored in the index directory.


VERSION 1.1 (February 15, 2007)
===============================

NONE

VERSION 1.1 RC1 (January 19, 2007)
==================================

1. CompassSearchController Spring MVC search callbacks removed. The search operation refactored to a
   utility class called CompassSearchHelper (with the same callbacks) which can be injected into the
   search controller.

VERSION 1.1 M3 (November 28, 2006)
==================================

1. Component max-depth default changed to 1 (from 5). Most cyclic component mappings are used
   for bi-directional relationship, where max-depth of 1 is fine. For tree based cyclic relationships
   max-depth should be set to an appropiate value. This change will result in much less memory consumption
   by compass.
2. Empty Collections/Arrays (size = 0) are returned as empty arrays / collections now, and not as nulls.

VERSION 1.1 M2 (September 27, 2006)
===================================

1. OSEM setting compass.managedId.index changed to compass.osem.managedId.index .
2. Removed Resource#setAlias.


VERSION 1.1 M1 (August 25, 2006)
================================

1. Removed CompassTermInfo and CompassSession API supporting it, and added it to 
   LuceneHelper. It now uses actual Lucene classes.


VERSION 1.0.0 (July 23, 2006)
=============================

1. When using Spring and Compass Gps, each device should be wrapped with
   org.compass.spring.device.SpringSyncTransactionGpsDeviceWrapper for better transaction handling.

VERSION 0.9.1 (May 27, 2006)
============================

No upgrade steps required to use 0.9.1.


VERSION 0.9.0 (Apr 17, 2006)
============================

1. Package name changed back to org.compass from org.compassframework.
   Due to the move to Open Symphony, the name Compass is back, without the Framework part.
2. DTD Location changed.
   http://static.compassframework.org/dtd/ prefix should now state: http://www.opensymphony.com/compass/dtd.
   The -1.0 version was removed.
3. Converters Support Enhancements and Changes.
   a) Removed converter-param from all the different mapping definitions in the Compass Core DTD.
   b) The converter element no longer points to an implementation class of the Converter class. Instead, it
      acts as a lookup name for a Converter (which was registered under the name).
   c) Since the converter-param was mostly used for formatting Dates and Numbers, the format attribute was
      added to the DTD, allowing for quick setting of the format, without going through the hassle of 
      defining a new Converter and registering it. Note, that it must be set only on formatting converters.
   d) Old way of registering new converters still works (CompassConfiguration#registerConverter).
   e) You can now configure new converters using Compass configuration settings. The converter setting is
      compass.converter.[converter name].[settings]. For example, to register a new DateConverter, two settings
      must be set, compass.converter.mydate.type=date, and compass.converter.mydate.format=yyyy-MM-dd. Now,
      you can use the mydate converter lookup name in the converter mapping attribute.
   f) You can now override default converters that comes with compass. They are registered under Compass
      default names. For example, to change the format for all Dates, simply provide the setting
      compass.converter.date.format=yyyy-MM-dd.
   For more information, please check the reference documentation.
4. Component and Reference mapping ref-alias is no longer required. Under certain conditions, Compass can infer
   the class mapping associated with the class property return type.
5. col-class mapping is no longer required and removed from the mapping definitions.
6. compass.engine.store.jdbc.dialect is no longer required when using Jdbc. 
   Compass will try to auto-detect the correct Dialect.
7. compass.transaction.managerLookup is no longer required when using JTA. 
   Compass will try to auto-detect it based on the JTA implementation used.
8. The setting for compound file format was wrongly named, changed to: compass.engine.useCompoundFile.
9. A new XML configuration based on XML schema is available. It is now the preferred way to configure Compass.

VERSION 0.8.1 (Jan 22, 2006)
============================

None.

VERSION 0.8.0 (Jan 02, 2006)
============================

1. Spring Transaction Manager.
   If using compass with a spring transaction manager (and probably using SpringSyncTransactionFactory),
   the transaction manager must be injected to the LocalCompassBean.
   The transactionManager property was removed from the CompassIndexController and CompassSearchController,
   now there is only one place to define the transactionManager that compass will integrate with, and that
   is the transactionManager of the LocalCompassBean.
2. CompassGps index Operation.
   When performing the index operation, it is very important in the new version NOT to perform it within an
   already running transaction. For LocalTransactionFactory, no outer LocalTransaction should be started.
   For JTATransactionFactory, no JTA transaction must be started, or no CMT transaction defined for the method
   level. For SpringSyncTransactionFactory, no spring transaction should be started before, and the executing
   method should not be wrapped with a transaction (using transaction proxy).

VERSION 0.7.0 (Dec 22, 2005)
============================

1. Actual Index directory moved to index sub directory.
   If specifying a file system location for the index, the sub indexes will be created under a directory
   called index (within the configured path). If you wish to use the same index from version 0.6.2, it is
   possible, but you will need to manually create the index directory, and move all the other directories
   into it.


VERSION 0.6.2 (Nov 22, 2005)
============================

1. Index control moved from Compass.
   A new interface called SearchEngineIndexManager will now handle all index related operations (like
   delete, verify). It is reachable from the Compass instance.
2. Minor API change in CompassDetachedHits.
   The toHits, toDatas, and toResources, were change and the to part was changed to get, for simpler usage
   in scripting langs (or JSP's).
3. CompassGps index functionality changed.
   CompassGps no longer has the deleteIndexBeforeIndex property, the two implementation will now gracefully
   replace the online index with the content of the index operation. Please consult the documentation for
   more information.

VERSION 0.6.1 (Sep 30, 2005)
============================

1. The mapping definition name excludeFromAll is changed to exclude-from-all.
2. The mapping definition name managedId is changed to managed-id.
3. CompassQueryBuilder#eq changed to CompassQueryBuilder#term
4. CompassQueryBuilder#eqAlias changed to CompassQueryBuilder#alias
5. CompassHits refactored to CompassHitsOperations, CompassHits and CompassDetachedHits. A better separation
   between the notion of hits (CompassHits) which can be used within a transactional context, and detached
   hits (CompassDetachedHits), that can be used outside of a transactional context. The CompassHitsOperations
   interface is used for operations that can be done on both hits. Also, several method were renamed/removed
   as per the general contract of hits (i.e. getScore(int n) removed and only score(int n) left).
6. The setting compass.engine.optimizer changed to compass.engine.optimizer.type.


VERSION 0.6 (Sep 30, 2005)
==========================

1. Package name changed from org.compass to org.compassframework.
2. DTD location changed to http://static.compassframework.org/dtd/compass-core-mapping.dtd.
3. The settings for the analyzer used was changed. Compass can now be configured with multiple
   analyzers, and they can be referenced. The new setting looks like: compass.analyzer.(analyzer name).*,
   with two internal analyzers called default and search. Please read more at the Search Analyzer section
   in the documentation.
4. Removed the DefaultCompassGps, which had two compass instances with the confusing names of compass
   and batchCompass. There will be two implementation of CompassGps now: a) DualCompassGps: Will act the
   same as DefaultCompassGps, but will have better names for the two compass instances: indexCompass and
   mirrorCompass. b) SingleCompassGps: Based on the fact that 0.6 version allows to set the transaction
   isolation when starting a new transaction, it will only have a single Compass instance. When indexing,
   the transaction will begin with the batch_insert transaction isolation, and when mirroring, using the
   configured transaction isolation. It is a simpler solution which should work in most cases, and have
   better memory performance.
